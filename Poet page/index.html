          <h3>Rebel Poet</h3>
          <p>
            Kazi Nazrul Islam (Bengali: কাজী নজরুল ইসলাম, Bengali pronunciation:
            [kād͡ʒi nôd͡ʒrul îslām] (About this soundlisten), 24 May 1899 – 29
            August 1976) was a Bengali poet, writer, musician and the national
            poet of Bangladesh. Popularly known as Nazrul, he produced a large
            body of poetry and music with themes that included religious
            devotion and rebellion against oppression. Nazrul's activism for
            political and social justice earned him the title of "Bidrohi Kobi"
            (Rebel Poet). His compositions form the avant-garde music genre of
            Nazrul Geeti (Music of Nazrul).
